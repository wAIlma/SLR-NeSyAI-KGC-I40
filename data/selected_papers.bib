abstract = {Hazardous chemicals are widely used in the production activities of the chemical industry. The risk management of hazardous chemicals is critical to the safety of life and property. Hence, the effective risk management of hazardous chemicals has always been important to the chemical industry. Since a large quantity of knowledge and information of hazardous chemicals is stored in isolated databases, it is challenging to manage hazardous chemicals in an information-rich manner. Herein, we prompt a knowledge graph to overcome the information gap between decentralized databases, which would improve the hazardous chemical management. In the implementation of the knowledge graph, we design an ontology schema of hazardous chemicals management. To facilitate enterprises to master the knowledge in the full lifecycle of hazardous chemicals, including production, transportation, storage, etc., we jointly use data from companies and open data from the public domain of hazardous chemicals to construct the knowledge graph. The named entity recognition task is one of the key tasks in the implementation of the knowledge graph, which is of great significance for extracting entity information from unstructured data, namely the hazardous chemical accidents records. To extract useful information from multi-source data, we adopt the pre-trained BERT-CRF model to conduct named entity recognition for incidents records. The model achieves good results, exhibiting the effectiveness in the task of named entity recognition in the chemical industry.},

abstract = {A CNC machine may contain various types of faults and may harm production safety in multiple ways. It is difficult for managers to determine which faults are more severe due to the complex structure of the machine. This further confuses managers to generate efficient preventions and responses. Consequently, there is a need to develop a method to assist production managers to identify the safety-critical components (SCCs) in a CNC machine. The current work developed a solid framework for SCCs examination using a riskbased knowledge graph method. Firstly, we summarize the structure of the CNC machine using ontology and examine CNC faults and corresponding consequences. The reasoning between faults and consequences is via literature examination using a web-crawler. This is followed by using BiLSTM-CRF for knowledge processing and using TransE for entity alignment. Then, a risk-based knowledge graph is developed via developing a weight scale for the severity of consequence; and using historical fault data to access frequency. The knowledge graph visualization is developed using Gephi, and SCCs can be virtually determined with deeper color in nodes as the darker color represents higher risk. This has the potential to help industry practitioners better understand their current operations situation and generate responses to avoid fault occurrence and improve production safety.},

Once it reaches failure, it will seriously affect the operation of the industrial system. This paper proposes a new method for multi-entity knowledge joint extraction (MEKJE) of IIoT communication equipment faults. This method constructs a multi-task tightly coupled model of fault entity and relationship extraction. We use it to implement word embedding and bidirectional semantic capture to generate computable text vectors. At the same time, a multi-entity segmentation method is proposed, which uses noise filtering to distinguish the multi-fault relationship of single corpus. We constructed a dataset of communication failures in power IIoT and conducted experiments. The experimental results show that the method performs best in tests with the Faulty Text dataset and the CLUENER dataset. In particular, the model achieves an F1 value of 78.6% in the evaluation of relationship extraction for multiple entities, and a significant improvement of 5â€“8% in its accuracy and recall. It enables effective mapping and accurate extraction of fault knowledge data.},

abstract = {Root cause analysis (RCA) plays an essential role in quality problem solving (QPS). Due to the difficulty of obtaining causal knowledge of quality problems, companies often rely on expert experience and conventional RCA tools when conducting RCA. Rich QPS data have remained mostly untapped but provide the potential for causal knowledge mining, while the semistructured nature of these data poses enormous challenges to this task. Thus, we propose a data-driven framework to mine large-scale causalities between quality problems and production factors from QPS data and exploit a causal knowledge graph for quality problems (QPCKG) to express these causalities. We first classify QPS data to identify the data containing causality. The causal linguistic patterns are then employed to extract cause slots and effect slots from these data. Subsequently, we apply the BiLSTM-CRF to extract the core content of problems. A vertex fusion method is last proposed to integrate discrete causalities into QPCKG. The approach is validated in a real-world application at a leading automotive company. Three potential applications of the QPCKG are demonstrated for quality diagnosis and prediction. The QPCKG reveals a grand picture of the core interaction mechanism of product quality and production factors and provides decision-making support for RCA.},

Currently, the manufacturing industry is in the critical period of transitioning to smart manufacturing, but the cognitive capabilities of devices in smart factories are still scarce. Knowledge Graph (KG) is one of the key technologies of cognitive intelligence, which opens a new path for the horizontal integration of intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, this paper proposes and builds a manufacturing equipment information query system based on KG. Firstly, a large amount of heterogeneous data that contains vast devices information is obtained from the network. Secondly, the conditional random fields (CRF) algorithm is used to extract the entity name, product place, and company name of the device, and then the relationship between the device entities is identified by calculating the similarity and Chinese syntax analysis. In the validation section, we use to the map of Neo4j graph database, when we input a name of a device in the search box, the system can return a relational graph node. In addition, the shortest path optimization algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between nodes in the search process to achieve the recommendation of similar node information.},

abstract = {There is a lack of high correlation and reuse potential among multiple manufacturing data for textiles and apparel. Moreover, the material flow traceability between production workstations is not clear, making it difficult to detect potential production bottlenecks. This paper proposes a knowledge graph embedded time serial data-driven bottleneck analysis of textile and apparel production processes. Firstly, a dynamic information association model is established to organize global manufacturing information, including the static data and time-series data features. Also, a textile-corpus-oriented knowledge extraction model is designed to construct a time-series knowledge graph for textile and apparel production (TKG4TA). Then, a temporal knowledge-driven production process bottleneck prediction model is presented based on manufacturing knowledge in the textile and apparel industry. Of these, textile knowledge is transformed into embeddings using a graph convolutional network (GCN). In turn, the context-associated information features are learned by the long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the bottlenecks in the textile and apparel production process. Finally, a typical process flow in a shirt manufacturing workshop is used as a case study. It shows that the F1 value of the proposed method for named entity recognition and relationship extraction is up to 80.3%, and 50.6%, respectively. The performance of the proposed model for bottleneck prediction is improved by 8.2% and 14.92% compared to only the use of GCN or LSTM in the mean absolute error. This model may provide a solid foundation for the temporal knowledge-graph-driven bottleneck analysis of shirt manufacturing.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis is the key concern in the operation and maintenance of industrial assets. A fault diagnosis knowledge graph (KG) can provide decision support to the engineers to efficiently conduct maintenance tasks. However, as a type of domain KG, it would be time-consuming to manually label the corpus collected from the multi-source including the maintenance log, handbook and article. Meanwhile, the existence of the noisy sentence in the multi-source corpus jeopardises the performance of relation extraction modelling. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a distant supervision relation extraction (DSRE)-based approach to construct a fault diagnosis KG. In this approach, the ontology of the fault diagnosis KG is firstly designed. Subsequently, a DSRE algorithm named relation-aware-based sentence-level attention enhanced piecewise convolutional neural network with reinforcement learning strategy (PCNN-ATTRA-RL) is proposed. The algorithm can effectively lower the impact of noisy sentences and accurately label the relation of different entities when the labelled data is insufficient. In this algorithm, PCNN-ATTRA is designed as the DSRE classifier to effectively extract the relation between entity pairs. RL is conducted to remove the noisy sentence so as to further improve the performance. An experimental study based on the multi-source corpus collected from the real world reveals that the proposed approach shows merits in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Meanwhile, a fault diagnosis KG, which can greatly support the decision-making of the engineers in the fault diagnosis, is established via the proposed approach.},

However, relationships are lacking in the welding domain. The relationship extraction and processing solution are designed to handle data with different characteristics in welding fabrication. The BiLSTM+Attention and CR-CNN models are employed to extract relations in unstructured documents. The neighborhood rough set-based association rule model is proposed for project-specific documents to accomplish relationship acquisition, in which invalid attributes are removed via neighborhood rough sets and attribute values are related via association rules. In addition, the knowledge graph is built based on extracted relationships, and unique empirical relationships are handled by introducing relational nodes and databases. The results show that BiLSTM+Attention gets a good score with Macro-average metrics (0.788 for Precision, 0.846 for Recall, and 0.816 for F1-score). The relational rules obtained via the proposed model are consistent with the production experience. The constructed knowledge graph effectively handles empirical relationships while positively impacting knowledge retrieval, intelligent question and answer, and decision-making for complex engineering problems.},

Firstly, SCM event argument classes and class relations are defined, an event logic ontology model is built, and the event argument entities according to event logic ontology are labeled. Then, an active learning event argument entity recognition (EAER) model based on two-stage generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. In GAN generator, an EAER model based on binocular attention-based stacked BiLSTM with CNN (BACSBN) is proposed, which combines word-level character feature attention mechanism and n-gram pooling feature attention mechanism to improve the attention to character features of constituent words and highlight entity key information with different lengths, respectively. Two-stage GAN adversarial training and label space attention mechanism are introduced to select the correct predicted label samples for active learning training. The experimental results show that BACSBN can improve the entity recognition accuracy, and the two-stage GAN's active learning can further improve the recognition effect on the basis of full annotation sample training, and can still maintain a high accuracy in the absence of a large number of manual annotation data.

Intelligent manufacturing seeks to establish a collaborative platform that integrates advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence into the manufacturing process, providing new opportunities for efficient and intelligent product design. Mining design knowledge from PLC data and applying it to the design stage is a critical issue that urgently needs to be addressed for data-driven product design (DDPD). To enhance the efficiency and adaptability of DDPD, this work proposes a comprehensive framework for extracting design knowledge from PLC data and utilizing the knowledge to inform the design process. A structured storage method is developed to manage PLC data with multi-source and heterogeneous characteristics.

Moreover, a product design knowledge network is constructed based on knowledge graph to achieve knowledge organization and management.

abstract = {Relation extraction is a crucial step in the constructions of knowledge graphs (KGs). However, relation extraction is performed manually in the manufacturing field due to the sentence characteristics, which include weak correlation and high entity density. This approach has the disadvantages of low efficiency and high dependence on experts. At present, very few studies have been performed on relation extraction in the manufacturing field, so establishing a relation extraction model with high efficiency is an urgent need. Therefore, in this paper, a relation extraction model is proposed for manufacturing knowledge (MKREM), in which word embedding is obtained by the Bi-LSTM layer to improve robustness, and a Simplified Graph Convolution Network (SGC) layer is applied to quickly mine the entity information. Then, dependency and semantic features are extracted by the multi-head stacked GCN and relation attention mechanism, respectively. Finally, the dependency and semantic features are fused to generate the comprehensive features for relation extraction so that better performance on texts with weak correlation and high entity density can be obtained. The performance of MKREM is tested by experiments on the equipment maintenance dataset and the quality dataset from an automobile enterprise, and its effectiveness is verified in the automobile manufacture filed. The results show that the F1 scores obtained using MKREM are 2% higher than those of the commonly used models on both datasets, and the F1 scores when using Contextualized-MKREM are improved by 3%, so MKREM is very suitable for the automatic relation extraction during establishing manufacturing KGs.},

abstract = {Process knowledge base is a core component in the intelligent process, which determines the intelligent degree of product manufacturing and directly affects the production efficiency of products. However, traditional process knowledge base is often constructed manually, which is difficult and time-consuming. In addition, in the field of machining, there is a large amount of unstructured invisible process knowledge, which is not effectively organized and managed. To make use of this knowledge and provide knowledge support for downstream production and maintenance, a process knowledge base construction framework is proposed by using Knowledge Graph (KG) technology. Firstly, the ontology rules of process knowledge are designed from the perspective of the processing method of process characteristics according to the particularity of knowledge in the machining field. The process KG schema layer is then constructed. Secondly, a neural network BERTâ€“Improved TRANSFORMERâ€“CRF (BITC) model is proposed for the machining knowledge extraction task, and the data layer is constructed. Then, entity linking and knowledge fusion are performed by using the word vector cosine similarity algorithm and stored in Neo4j. The process KG is then constructed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by using an aero-engine casing of an enterprise as an example. Under the same dataset, the BITC model scored higher than several other classical models. The Precision, Recall, and F1-score were 85.27%, 86.40%, and 85.83 %, respectively.},

In this article, a resource-based industrial knowledge graph is developed using a few-shot classification algorithm to save on labor and other related costs in industrial knowledge graph construction, and an attribute-based fusion strategy for data fusion and alignment is designed. We also propose a novel metrics-based meta-learning model with meta-pretraining (MMM) to address the few-shot text classification problem. Experiment results show that MMM achieves 87.13% accuracy on the 5-shot text classification benchmark Amazon Review Sentiment Classification (ARSC), outperforming other baselines, such as Induction Networks (85.63%) and Distributional Signatures (81.16%). The MMM achieves a 34.6% accuracy improvement compared with Distributional Signatures (84.34% vs. 62.66%) on 1-shot problems of ARSC, hence highlighting the applicability of our model in low-resource conditions. Based on the proposed methods, we further develop an industrial knowledge graph platform with industrial applications, such as value chain analysis and collaboration, to improve knowledge reuse and service innovation.},

abstract = {The manufacturing industry is currently experiencing a wave of digitalization and intelligent transformation. With continuous upgrades of production equipment and systems, the complexity and diversity of production line faults are continuously increasing. Moreover, there is a weak correlation among fault-related information and a low utilization rate of fault knowledge. In light of the problems, an automatic knowledge graph construction framework is proposed for production line fault maintenance. The framework employs both BERT-based models and template-based methods to extract entities and relationships from text data. First, by obtaining relevant engineering documents from the production line and considering their characteristics, a pattern layer of the production line fault maintenance knowledge graph (PLFMKG) is constructed. Then, the BERT-BILSTM-CRF deep learning algorithm is applied to extract corresponding entities from the engineering documents related to production line faults. Subsequently, a template-based method is employed to extracting relationships. Meanwhile, a Chinese named entity recognition dataset is also established. consisting of three hundred sentences from engineering documents related to production line faults. Experimental results show that the BERT-based knowledge extraction method outperforms classic BiLSTM-CRF and BERT-LSTM-CRF models in processing production line fault maintenance data, validating its effectiveness. Finally, we visualize the constructed knowledge graph using the Neo4j graph database. The production line fault maintenance knowledge graph provides data support for subsequent production line fault reasoning and decision-making processes.},

Such data is in a highly dynamic state, while the relationship between the data is more complex. However, the current use of traditional relational data to store the whole life cycle data of custom apparel products has several problems of high redundancy, weak correlation, discrete distribution, and certain limitation of storage capacity. Therefore, based on knowledge graph, a dynamic knowledge modeling and fusion method is proposed for the production process of custom apparel. Firstly, an ontology-based knowledge modeling method is designed for custom apparel, which defined three types of ontology modeling methods for the process, resources, and features. On this basis, a knowledge graph construction method based on bi-directional fusion for the custom apparel production system is proposed. With one order as a unit, a knowledge graph facet (KGF) model, as well as the derived knowledge representation, generation and fusion method, is established to realize dynamic knowledge fusion of the custom apparel production process. Finally, taking the suit production process of a custom apparel factory as an example, the corresponding knowledge graph is constructed based on the ontology knowledge model, and the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge fusion method is verified.},

Knowledge-based work plays a central role in the practical application of intelligent manufacturing because the staff have professional knowledge of production and manufacturing after learning, undergoing training, and thinking. They can use their knowledge to analyze complex states, assess them accurately, and make innovative decisions. Therefore, expressing and constructing IR data and knowledge is a key issue in the application of knowledge to the predictive maintenance (PdM) of IRs. Considering the intelligent management of IRs as the research objective of this study, a PdM method based on data and knowledge was developed. A running-state feature-recognition model based on a long short-term memory network was first established to recognize future running states using the history and real-time running data of IRs. Furthermore, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to analyze the correlation between the running-state feature data and faults to predict possible faults. The prediction results were then input into the knowledge graphs (KGs) of IRs for reasoning. PdM strategies were automatically formulated based on the KGs. Finally, a PdM system for IRs was designed and developed. The effectiveness of the proposed method and system were verified by applying them to the welding robots in a new energy automotive welding workshop. The findings of this study provide new concepts and tools for the PdM of IRs, as well as theoretical and methodological support for the production stability of intelligent manufacturing.},

We employ deep learning (DL)-based models to obtain semantic information related to product quality prediction using time series data collected from IoT devices. Then the prediction information is attached to the specified node in the knowledge graph. Thus, the knowledge graph will describe the dynamic semantic information of manufacturing contexts. Meanwhile, a dynamic event link reasoning model that uses graph embedding to aggregate manufacturing processes information is proposed. The implicit information with industrial temporal knowledge can be further mined and inferred. The case study has shown that the proposed knowledge graph link reasoning reflects dynamic temporal characteristics.

Due to the lack of knowledge, design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) is now a major challenge in utilizing AM's product innovation and manufacturing capabilities. The AM sector will benefit from developing an intuitive knowledge reasoning method by constructing a Knowledge Graph (KG). We presented Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT) model for collaborative entity/relation recognition to address the issue, allowing us to study and utilize the advantages of AM through knowledge reasoning for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) based DFAM. First, the model analyzes preprocessed text to find and extract entities. Then, the relation recognition procedure based on dependency parsing extracts the semantic relationships between the entities. To convert word segments into vectors and improve dependency parsing, we used Continuous-Bag-of-Words (CBOW) to process texts. Therefore, this allowed us to anticipate the probability output of the center word based on the n âˆ’ 1 words around the input. The extracted knowledge is then visualized as a graph and stored in the Neo4j database. Following the methods above creates a KG for the FDM-based DFAM knowledge. It can be shown that BERT is a good option for handling knowledge-driven issues needing specialists by extracting the process knowledge from text data using our suggested model. We provide evidence demonstrating the model's ability to set reasonable limitations on its predictions through a KG. Additionally, we use experiments and an application case study to demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our approach.},

Current studies mainly focus on defect recognition and classification using machine vision-based algorithms, which lack the trace of potential causes and the reuse of experiential knowledge. To address this issue, we construct a knowledge graph for steel surface defects by fusing the multi-source and heterogeneous industrial data, including process parameters, chemical compositions, defect images, operation logs and empirical knowledge. A policy-based reinforcement learning approach is developed to solve the path reasoning problem over the industrial knowledge graph in defect detection and diagnosis. The approach employs two agents to explore the path efficiently from opposite directions, utilizes an integrated reward function that comprehensively considers the path direction, path length and entity distance to perform action selection, and adopts the path sharing mechanism and the prior knowledge to update selection policy. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art knowledge reasoning algorithms on two benchmark datasets, NELL-995 and FB15K-237, validate the performance and merits of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also evaluated on a practical steel surface defect dataset, and the results show that our approach performs well in knowledge reasoning on the surface defect graph. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;The surface quality of products has become a widely concerned focus in manufacturing industries. With the development of industrial IoT and Cyber-physical system technologies, more and more industrial data has been collected, and machine learning-based algorithms have been developed and applied to the recognition of detect defects.

abstract = {The process knowledge base is the key module in intelligent process design, it determines the intelligence degree of the design system and affects the quality of product design. However, traditional process knowledge base construction is non-automated, time consuming and requires much manual work, which is not sufficient to meet the demands of the modern manufacturing mode. Moreover, the knowledge base often adopts a single knowledge representation, and this may lead to ambiguity in the meaning of some knowledge, which will affect the quality of the process knowledge base. To overcome the above problems, an automatic construction framework for the process knowledge base in the field of machining based on knowledge graph (KG) is introduced. First, the knowledge is classified and annotated based on the function-behavior-states (FBS) design method. Second, a knowledge extraction framework based on BERT-BiLSTM-CRF is established to perform the automatic knowledge extraction of process text. Third, a knowledge representation method based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established, forming three types of knowledge representation with the KG as the main, production rules and two-dimensional data linked list as a supplement. In addition, to overcome the redundancy in the knowledge fusion stage, a hybrid algorithm based on an improved edit distance and attribute weighting is built. Finally, a prototype system is developed, and quality analysis is carried out. Compared with the F values of BiLSTM-CRF and CNN-BiLSTM-CRF, that of the proposed extraction method in the machining domain is increased by 7.35% and 3.87%, respectively.},

abstract = {The images of surface defects of industrial products contain not only the defect type but also the causal logic related to defective design and manufacturing. This information is recessive and unstructured and difficult to find and use, which cannot provide an apriori basis for solving the problem of product defects in design and manufacturing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an image semantic refinement recognition method based on causal knowledge for product surface defects. Firstly, an improved ResNet was designed to improve the image classification effect. Then, the causal knowledge graph of surface defects was constructed and stored in Neo4j. Finally, a visualization platform for causal knowledge analysis was developed to realize the causal visualization of the defects in the causal knowledge graph driven by the output data of the network model. In addition, the method is validated by the surface defects dataset. The experimental results show that the average accuracy, recall, and precision of the improved ResNet are improved by 11%, 8.15%, and 8.3%, respectively. Through the application of the visualization platform, the cause results obtained are correct by related analysis and comparison, which can effectively represent the cause of aluminum profile surface defects, verifying the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.},

abstract = {Accidents in chemical production usually result in fatal injury, economic loss and negative social impact. Chemical accident reports which record past accident information, contain a large amount of expert knowledge. However, manually finding out the key factors causing accidents needs reading and analyzing of numerous accident reports, which is time-consuming and labor intensive. Herein, in this paper, a semi-automatic method based on natural language process (NLP) technology is developed to construct a knowledge graph of chemical accidents. Firstly, we build a named entity recognition (NER) model using SoftLexicon (simplify the usage of lexicon) + BERT-Transformer-CRF (conditional random field) to automatically extract the accident information and risk factors. The risk factors leading to accident in chemical accident reports are divided into five categories: human, machine, material, management, and environment. Through analysis of the extraction results of different chemical industries and different accident types, corresponding accident prevention suggestions are given. Secondly, based on the definition of classes and hierarchies of information in chemical accident reports, the seven-step method developed at Stanford University is used to construct the ontology-based chemical accident knowledge description model. Finally, the ontology knowledge description model is imported into the graph database Neo4j, and the knowledge graph is constructed to realize the structured storage of chemical accident knowledge. In the case of information extraction from 290 Chinese chemical accident reports, SoftLexicon + BERT-Transformer-CRF shows the best extraction performance among nine experimental models. Demonstrating that the method developed in the current work can be a promising tool in obtaining the factors causing accidents, which contributes to intelligent accident analysis and auxiliary accident prevention.},

A novel end-to-end ITIESF approach is proposed to integrate tabular information and construct a tabular information-oriented causality event evolutionary knowledge graph (TCEEKG). Specifically, an end-to-end joint learning strategy is presented to mine the semantic information in tables. The definition and modeling method of the intrinsic relationships between tables with their rows and columns in engineering documents are provided to model the tabular information. Due to this, an end-to-end joint entity relationship extraction method for textual and tabular information from engineering documents is proposed to construct text-based knowledge graphs (KG) and tabular information-based causality event evolutionary graphs (CEEG). Then, a novel NSGCN (neighborhoods sample graph convolution network)-based entity alignment is proposed to fuse the cross-knowledge graphs into a unified knowledge base. Furthermore, a translation-based graph structure-driven Q&A (question and answer) approach is designed to respond to cause analysis and problem tracing. Our models can be easily integrated into a prototype system to provide a joint information processing and cognitive analysis. Finally, the approach is evaluated by employing the aerospace machining documents to illustrate that the TCEEKG can considerably help workers strengthen their skills in the cause-and-effect analysis of machining quality issues from a global perspective.},

abstract = {With the escalating complexity in production scenarios, vast amounts of production information are retained within enterprises in the industrial domain. Probing questions of how to meticulously excavate value from complex document information and establish coherent information links arise. In this work, we present a framework for knowledge graph construction in the industrial domain, predicated on knowledge-enhanced document-level entity and relation extraction. This approach alleviates the shortage of annotated data in the industrial domain and models the interplay of industrial documents. To augment the accuracy of named entity recognition, domain-specific knowledge is incorporated into the initialization of the word embedding matrix within the bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) framework. For relation extraction, this paper introduces the knowledge-enhanced graph inference (KEGI) network, a pioneering method designed for long paragraphs in the industrial domain. This method discerns intricate interactions among entities by constructing a document graph and innovatively integrates knowledge representation into both node construction and path inference through TransR. On the application stratum, BiLSTM-CRF and KEGI are utilized to craft a knowledge graph from a knowledge representation model and Chinese fault reports for a steel production line, specifically SPOnto and SPFRDoc. The F1 value for entity and relation extraction has been enhanced by 2% to 6%. The quality of the extracted knowledge graph complies with the requirements of real-world production environment applications. The results demonstrate that KEGI can profoundly delve into production reports, extracting a wealth of knowledge and patterns, thereby providing a comprehensive solution for production management.},

Equipment maintenance management is facing significant challenges in terms of maintenance workload, system reliability and stability requirements and the overall skill requirements of maintenance personnel. Equipment maintenance management is also developing in the direction of intellectualization. It is important to have a method to construct a domain knowledge graph and to organize and utilize it. As is well known, traditional equipment maintenance is mainly dependent on technicians, and they are required to be very familiar with the maintenance manuals. But it is very difficult to manage and exploit a large quantity of knowledge for technicians in a short time. Hence a method to construct a knowledge graph (KG) for equipment maintenance is proposed to extract knowledge from manuals, and an effective maintenance scheme is obtained with this knowledge graph. Firstly, a joint model based on an enhanced BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF is put forward to extract knowledge automatically, and a Cosine and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) based on semantic similarity a presented to eliminate redundancy in the process of the knowledge fusion. Finally, a Decision Support System (DSS) for equipment maintenance is developed and implemented, in which knowledge can be extracted automatically and provide an equipment maintenance scheme according to the requirements. The experimental results show that the joint model used in this paper performs well on Chinese text related to equipment maintenance, with an F1 score of 0.847. The quality of the knowledge graph constructed after eliminating redundancy is also significantly improved.},

In this paper, we report on work towards developing robust knowledge graphs based upon entity and relation data for both commercial and educational uses. To create the FabKG (Manufacturing knowledge graph), we have utilized textbook index words, research paper keywords, FabNER (manufacturing NER), to extract a sub knowledge base contained within Wikidata. Moreover, we propose a novel crowdsourcing method for KG creation by leveraging student notes, which contain invaluable information but are not captured as meaningful information, excluding their use in personal preparation for learning and written exams. We have created a knowledge graph containing 65000+ triples using all data sources.

To realize accurate and efficient equipment FD, this article proposes a steel production line equipment FD knowledge graph (SPLEFD-KG) based on a novel relation-oriented model with global context information for jointly extracting overlapping relations and entities (ROMGCJE). A low-level self-learning SPLEFD-KG is first constructed using the triples extracted by ROMGCJE. However, this low-level SPLEFD-KG is incomplete, and only contains sparse paths for fault reasoning. To overcome this problem, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework is applied to mine hidden semantic knowledge to complete the missing relation. Besides, the graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) are introduced to compute the embedding vector of new entities outside of the SPLEFD-KG for continuously completing missing entities. Finally, the low-level self-learning SPLEFD-KG evolves to one high-level SPLEFD-KG, which can provide information-rich and accurate fault-related knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on the steel production line equipment failure (SPLEF) dataset indicate that the novel SPLEFD-KG significantly improves FD results and provides effective maintenance programs.},

abstract = {In this paper, Bidirectional Mapping Relation Triple Extraction (BMRTE) is proposed to address the challenges of numerous overlapping triples and centralized knowledge in fault maintenance texts, enabling the construction of a fault knowledge graph. The pre-trained language model BERT is employed in BMRTE for the generation of an initial vector representation for each token in the texts. A binary tagging framework is used to identify base entities that may be related in the text on the basis of encoding tokens. To extract entity pairs from the text effectively, the bidirectional mapping framework is designed to map the base entities to their associated entities. Finally, multiple relation classification matrices are used to identify entity pairs and determine the relation triple. Our proposed model outperforms the compared baselines, as evidenced by the experimental results obtained from both a widely used public dataset and our labeled fault maintenance dataset.},

abstract = {Product Design based Knowledge graphs (KG) aid the representation of product assemblies through heterogeneous relationships that link entities obtained from multiple structured and unstructured sources. This study describes an approach to constructing a multi-relational and multi-hierarchical knowledge graph that extracts information contained within the 3D product model data to construct Assembly-Subassembly-Part and Shape Similarity relationships. This approach builds on a combination of utilizing 3D model meta-data and structuring the graph using the Assembly-Part hierarchy alongside 3D Shape-based Clustering. To demonstrate our approach, from a dataset consisting of 110,770 CAD models, 92,715 models were organized into 7,651 groups of varying sizes containing highly similar shapes, demonstrating the varied nature of design repositories, but inevitably also containing a significant number of repetitive and unique designs. Using the Product Design Knowledge Graph, we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D shape retrieval using Approximate Nearest Neighbor search. Finally, we illustrate the use of the KG for Design Reuse of co-occurring components, Rule-Based Inference for Assembly Similarity and Collaborative Filtering for Multi-Modal Search of manufacturing process conditions. Future work aims to expand the KG to include downstream data within product manufacturing and towards improved reasoning methods to provide actionable suggestions for design bot assistants and manufacturing automation.},
