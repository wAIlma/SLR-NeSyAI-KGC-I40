## Overview
This repository contains all the artifacts, data, and scripts related to the systematic literature review (SLR) on Knowledge Graph Construction using Neuro-Symbolic AI focused on manufacturing use cases. 

The main question to guide this review is, ‚Äú*Which role play neuro-symbolic AI approaches in knowledge graph construction for Manufacturing?*"

Originally, **981** obtained search results, and **53** remained after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria during the screening process. Additional **four** reports were excluded based on quality criteria, of which **three** because of the publishing venue's low ranking. The remaining **49** reports result in **5%** of the overall search corpus. This is reasonable as the focus of neuro-symbolic approaches is not specified in our search query, and a resulting lower precision is expected.
