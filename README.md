## Overview
This repository contains all the artefacts, data, and scripts related to the systematic literature review (SLR) on Knowlwdge Graph Construction using NeuroSymbolic AI focused on manofactiring use-cases. 

The main question to guide this review is ‚ÄúWhich role play neuro-symbolic AI approaches in knowledge graph construction for Manufacturing?

From originally **981** obtained search results, **53** remained after applying inclusion and exclusing criteria during the screening process. Additional **four** reports were excluded based on quality criteria, thereof **three** because of a low ranking of the publishing venue. The remaining **49** reports result in **5%** of the overall search corpus. This is reasonable as the focus of *neuro-symbolic* approaches is not specified in our search query and a resulting lower precision is expected.
